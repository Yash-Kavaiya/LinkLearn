## Purpose of the `.gitignore` file

The `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This helps to keep the repository clean by excluding files that are not necessary to be tracked, such as build artifacts, temporary files, and other files that do not need to be versioned.

### Python-specific ignore patterns

We have added the following Python-specific ignore patterns to the `.gitignore` file:

- `__pycache__/`: Ignores Python bytecode cache directories.
- `*.py[cod]`: Ignores compiled Python files.
- `*.pyo`: Ignores optimized Python files.
